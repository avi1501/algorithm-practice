stack is a Abstract data type 

It is very similar to the 
Physical stack 

Stack Operations ]

PUSH 
this operation is 
to insert element in the stack

the pushed element goes on top 
we insert element onto stack and 
the last element to be pushed is the 
new top of the stack


POP

There is another operation that we can 
perform is popping when we take the top book of
the stack and remove it 


Peek 
another thing that we can do is view the \
top element of stack so we can ask the data structure 
that what is the top element



class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
    self.items = []

    def push():

    def pop():
    

    def peek():
